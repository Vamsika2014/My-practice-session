 iii) So first they have given 2 test cases.
      For 1 hour cooler requires 2 litres of water and for 2 hours the cooler requires 4 litres of water to cool.As i observed it requires double liters of water for a given 
      time.


2)i)4
    N X  K
    5 10 70
    5 10 40
   10 40 400
   14 14 150
 ii)YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
 iii)So first they have gievn 4 test cases which we have to take it as input.And then by using for loop we have to check N*X<=K. if it is print yes or else no
     (BY THE WAY I HAVE SOLVED THIS SUM WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE WITH 100% SCORE.)

 iii) So they have given 4 test cases which we have to take it as input. And then another input to represent number of frames.According to do my analysis if there are
      same frame values side by side just skip it and print the remaining number of frames.

  iii)take 3 testcases as input.2nd line numbers of persons between ali and gihun and thier height as they both have same height. 3rd line persons height who are 
      between them.we have to print the count of those number of persons who should get shot first (i.e more than their height) so that they both sholud visible in a 
      same line
